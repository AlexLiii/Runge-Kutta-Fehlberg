#+TITLE: Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg 7(8) Method for Astro-dynamics

* Purpose
Using Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg 7(8) method for solving numerical problems
in astro-dynamics, for example, two-body and three-body problems.

* Usage
** two-body problem
Modify the  parameters at the beginning of =twobody.cpp=, and
type following command in your *nix terminal:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  make
  make run
  make plot
#+END_SRC
